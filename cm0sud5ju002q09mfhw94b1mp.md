The journey of becoming a successful software engineer doesn’t end when you complete a program like ALX SE—it’s just the beginning! Recently, in an [X Space](https://x.com/julienbarbier42/status/1832102377501098076) with [**Julien Barbier**](https://x.com/julienbarbier42), [**co-founder of Holberton School**](https://x.com/holbertonschool) and [**Chief Product Officer at ALX**](https://x.com/alx_africa), we explored the importance of building side projects for career growth in tech. Whether you’re a budding software engineer or just graduated from the ALX SE program, this is advice you don’t want to miss :)

### **Why Side Projects Matter**

Building side projects isn’t just a fun way to apply what you’ve learned—it’s necessary.

> *“Building a side project will help you learn things that you cannot learn in a structured learning environment like the ALX SE program.” —* Julien Barbier.

This may seem counterintuitive at first, but it highlights the importance of contextual learning. Side projects expose you to real-world challenges that aren’t covered in a curriculum. These projects also keep you current with industry trends and help you gain practical experience that employers value.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Julien mentioned, <em>“Two years building side projects = two years of experience.”</em></div>
</div>

This is especially true when you can’t find a job right away. Instead of waiting for opportunities, create them by continuing to build. The launch of Julien's and [***Kalibetre's***](https://x.com/kalibetre) [***Virtual Try-On***](https://x.com/julienbarbier42/status/1829979231855788414) side project emphasizes the growing importance of this approach in modern tech careers (check it out, if you haven't 😏).

### **Overcoming Job Market Challenges**

After completing a rigorous program like ALX SE, it might feel like you’ve conquered the hardest part. But the truth is, ***finishing ALX SE is just the beginning***!

> The current job market is tough, and landing a job can be much harder than expected. You’re not just competing with peers—you’re up against experienced professionals from around the world, thanks to the rise of remote work.

A [**graph of job postings**](https://x.com/julienbarbier42/status/1831831289525408024) (👈 check them out) shared by Julien shows just how competitive the landscape has become.

Given the wave of tech layoffs reported on platforms like [***Layoffs.fyi***](http://Layoffs.fyi), it’s clear that the competition is fierce.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><em>Your edge comes from the projects you’ve built.</em></div>
</div>

***Side projects serve as your portfolio, showcasing your skills to potential employers.***

> Julien stressed that building a variety of projects helps you avoid stagnation and keeps your skills sharp. If you don’t continue building, you risk wasting the knowledge you’ve gained. As he put it, *“Either you grow, or you die.”*

### **The Right Mindset for Success**

Julien also discussed the mindset needed for success in the tech industry.

> *“Don’t make excuses, just do it,”* he said, emphasizing the importance of taking action.

It’s ***easy to fall into the trap*** of thinking you require more courses or certifications, but in reality, you already have the basics.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong><em>The key is to apply what you know</em></strong>. If you’re unsure where to start, revisit the concepts you’ve learned and build something that solves a real problem.</div>
</div>

Julien also highlighted ***the importance of not getting sidetracked by hackathons.*** While hackathons have their place, they often involve building something quickly only to discard it later. Side projects, on the other hand, are sustained efforts that contribute to long-term growth.

> ***“***[***Hackathons are good; side projects are better!***](https://x.com/julienbarbier42/status/1832208513625673868)***”*** *— Julien Barbier*

### **Dealing with Imposter Syndrome**

No discussion about career growth is complete without addressing imposter syndrome.

Julien reminded us that *“there is no way you will succeed without having haters.”*

***Criticism is inevitable, and it often indicates that you’re making significant progress.***

As Theodore Roosevelt once said,

> ***“It is not the critic who counts; the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.”***

You can find the quote [here](https://x.com/julienbarbier42/status/1831808386037641361).

*“If you’re afraid, do it afraid,”* Julien added, urging us not to let fear stop us from pushing our boundaries. The truth is, your users do not remember the process of development—they remember the product.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong><em>Focus on creating something worthwhile, even if you’re not confident at first. Don’t let imposter syndrome hold you back from achieving your goals.</em></strong></div>
</div>

### **Monetizing and Beyond**

Interestingly, Julien also touched on the potential to monetize side projects, including open-source ones.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong><em>While the main goal should be learning, growth, and experience, finding ways to earn from your projects can be a bonus.</em></strong></div>
</div>

Everyone has different goals—if making money is one of yours, especially if you can’t find a job, then go make money! But ***whether you’re building for money or experience, the key is to keep building.***

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>A Quick View At Julien Barbier's Career Journey</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">Julien’s own career journey is a testament to this mindset. After graduating, he quickly found success with side projects. One of his early projects, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://Notetonentreprise.fr" style="pointer-events: none">Notetonentreprise.fr</a>, reached 100,000 monthly active users within three days and gained widespread media attention in France, including features on TV and radio. This success led to the founding of his first company, as mentioned in an article in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.latribune.fr/" style="pointer-events: none">La Tribune</a>. He continued to build and innovate. At Docker, he co-created <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/06/techmeabroad/" style="pointer-events: none">TechMeAbroad</a>, a platform that helped tech professionals find job opportunities abroad. This project eventually led to the creation of Holberton School after a series of pivots.</div></details>

Julien’s story is a testament to the importance of perseverance:

> *Fail, pivot, fail, pivot, fail, pivot, succeed :)*

He also shared his experience at a [**TechCrunch hackathon**](https://techcrunch.com/video/suntrip-co-demo-at-hackathon-sf-2013/), where he built a project before hitting growth with [**TechMeAbroad**](https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/06/techmeabroad/). It’s a reminder that side projects and hackathons can lead to unexpected opportunities.

### **Final Thoughts**

Julien’s advice is clear: ***Don’t stop building***.

Whether you’re fresh out of the ALX SE program or a seasoned developer, continuous learning through side projects sets you apart in a competitive job market.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong><em>So, don’t wait—start building, start learning, and keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.</em></strong></div>
</div>

And remember: *“Graduate first,”* but don’t let that be the end of your learning journey. Your career is just getting started.
