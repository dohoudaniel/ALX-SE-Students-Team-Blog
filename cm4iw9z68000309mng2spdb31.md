Finishing a tech program or boot camp is one achievement, but landing your first job in tech is another. It’s human to feel unprepared or inadequate, as you scroll through available job postings on your device. Feeling overwhelmed? You’re at the right place and at the right time. 🤩

On December 6, 2024, [**Julien Barbier**](https://x.com/julienbarbier42), [**Sophie Barbier**](https://x.com/Sophie_RB42) and [**Mounssif Bouhlaoui**](https://x.com/nuux_tv) **from** [**PrepForSuccess.ai**](https://prepforsuccess.ai/), [**Loveth Awusi**](https://x.com/Tech_Gal_Loveth), and [**Cobby Solomon**](https://x.com/hunterxcobby) hosted a transformative unrecorded 𝕏 Space (formerly Twitter), tackling one of the biggest challenges for techies: ***How to land your first tech job***. With over 3,000 attendees, it felt less like a casual chat and more like an [**#ALX\_SE**](https://x.com/hashtag/ALX_SE?src=hashtag_click) online conference! 🚀

Landing your first tech job isn’t easy, but it is not impossible either. All you need is **the right mix of hard work, smart preparation, and networking.** 🙃

Let’s dive into **the key takeaways from this transformative session**, starting with Cobby’s inspiring journey.

### Cobby's Story: A Tale Of Preparation 🎯

The 𝕏 space began with Cobby sharing his story of how he landed his first tech job. No, I won’t be telling you everything he said 😅, but here’s a highlight you’ll need:

* Cobby landed his job **through a LinkedIn referral** (showing how crucial a strong online presence and meaningful connections are).
    
* **He juggled his final ALX SE web stack project** while prepping for the interview (with support from his teammates [**Segun Adeleke**](https://x.com/OxSegun), [**Favour Michael**](https://x.com/Froches_), and [**Daniel Dohou**](https://x.com/DohouDaniel10)**)**.
    
* **His preparation was thorough.** He didn’t just study the company’s mission and goals, he also built side projects directly related to their work.
    
* Cobby **visited the company’s location ahead of time** and **arrived an hour early for his interview** (this was an edge for him).
    
* Despite his strong prep, he **hadn’t practiced the specific programming language** enough, relative to his job interview (A note-worthy mistake).
    

Cobby was truly prepared, and he made that **little extra effort**. The lesson is: **#DoTheWork! :)**

After Cobby shared his story, Julien, Sophie, Nuux, Cobby, and Loveth shared invaluable advice, with other lessons from Cobby’s story. They offered expert advice on the key preparations needed to break into the tech job market, from mastering the art of networking to having a solid personal brand.

Cobby’s story is worth learning from, but what about you? Diving head-first, here are the key points that can help you land your first job in tech (you might want to grab a pen to jot down, or maybe bookmark this):

> "You can't pray for a job and prepare for failure." — Cobby Solomon.

The essential steps to prepare effectively talked about on the 𝕏 space are:

1. **<mark>Optimize your portfolio, resume, and LinkedIn profiles:</mark>** Tailoring your resume and LinkedIn profile to align with the roles you're applying for, gives you an edge during the reviews of job applications. Ensure to keep your contact details on your resume up-to-date, to avoid a breach of contact. Showcase side projects relevant to job requirements on your portfolio as well.
    
2. **<mark>Thoroughly research the company:</mark>** Know the company’s culture, mission, product(s), and goals. Test out their product(s) too (you might find out relevant skills you possess that are needed for the job). When needed during the interview, you can even relate the benefits of the company product and the things you're interested in. This proves your professionalism, interest, and commitment (meaning they can count on you).
    
3. **<mark>Remote Interviews</mark>**<mark>:</mark> Ensure your camera, WiFi connection, laptop, microphone, and any other devices you will be using are in excellent condition, and nothing could cause any disruptions!
    
4. **<mark>Answering Interview Questions:</mark>** Practice key interview questions, like *“Where do you see yourself in 5 years?”* or *“Tell us about yourself”*. Never forget to answer questions like these in alignment with the company’s goals, culture, and product. This always gives you an edge!
    
5. **<mark>Selling Yourself As The Best Fit:</mark>** If you’re asked to share your professional experience, be specific! Relate an example or use case of where you applied your skills. Focus on talking about your achievements, vision, and goals. Be confident when answering these questions, but don’t be overconfident :)
    
6. <mark>“</mark>***<mark>I Don’t Know”?</mark>*:** If you’re asked a question you don’t have, **your response tells everything about your problem-solving ability**. It’s much better to whiteboard, brainstorm, and think of ways to solve the problem. **Never say** *“I don't know".*
    
7. **<mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark>:** AI tools like [**<mark>Prep4SuccessAI</mark>**](https://prepforsuccess.ai/)**, and** [**<mark>VeniCodiVici</mark>**](https://www.venicodivici.com/) are available to help you sharpen your interview readiness. Leverage them!
    
8. **<mark>Be punctual</mark>**: When preparing for an interview, aim to show up an hour or two early for the interview.
    
9. **<mark>One Tip</mark>:** Don’t forget to revisit programming languages and core technical concepts—being prepared in your specialization will set you apart.
    
10. **<mark>Another Tip</mark>:** Don't apply for jobs only when you're 100% ready. You can give it a go when you’re at least 70% ready.

</div>

Every techie has felt a wave of **<mark>Imposter Syndrome</mark>** at one point or the other in their tech journey. And they still do. Guess what? *I did too while writing this blog post 🤸🏾‍♂️*. Imposter Syndrome is that persistent feeling of inadequacy, despite evident achievements, skills, and growth. It is a common challenge among every techie, so feeling this way is normal and human.

But there’s a downside: When preparing for technical or non-technical interviews, imposter syndrome can affect your confidence, emotion, and eventually your level of preparedness for your career growth.

On the 𝕏 space, essential steps to beating imposter syndrome were shared. Here they are:

1. **<mark>A Positive Mindset</mark>**: This might take a lot of mental effort, but take this step *seriously*. Take deep breaths, you have to tell yourself and rewire your brain into believing that you’re capable and confident enough, and that you can face any challenge in preparation that could come your way.
    
2. **<mark>Truly Prepare</mark>**: Put in the effort, build side projects if you have to, follow each of the points already shared in this blog, clear any concerns or doubts you might have pertaining to the interview. This definitely silences that inner voice of inadequacy. **Just #DoTheWork!**
    
3. **<mark>Multitasking VS Your Health</mark>**: If you’re juggling too many strenuous activities that normally require your full focus, you will feel overwhelmed. But you must <mark>Prioritize</mark>. Carve out a path or a schedule that works for you based on your priorities, and follow it. *Never neglect your health, especially your mental health.* Learn to Focus!
